1. I believe that django rest uses both basic and session based authentication method. During login, the server would respond with a cookie that contains the session Id. And any queries made from the browser would be made with a sessionId cookie to authenticate.
2. A Basic authentication scheme is used
3. Token Based authentication doesn't involve sending user information over the internet, which could be spoofed. Token can also be used to provide different privileges over the API.
